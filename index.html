        This first project is called Pet-webpage.  It showcases some simple HTML and CSS. This page celebrates our neighbor's cat. His name is Fries.

        This next project was a fun group project called Animal-Shelter.  We used HTML and CSS on this as well. We built this webpage in the VsCode text editor.  We were putting our new knowledge of building rows and columns to use.

      <p>
      I have spent most my adult career working in the service industry. It has been a lot of fun, but I am ready to pivot and learn some new skills.  I am excited to be in an Epicodus program and looking forward to starting a new career in computer programming. I have some college under my belt already.  I was studying to be a nurse and I also took loads of art classes. However, I lost interest in becoming a nurse. I did enjoy all the science and biology that was required. Being creative and finding fun outlets is still a priority of mine.  Art is life.  You can find me outdoors in my free time. I love adventure, even if it's a simple urban adventure. There is a lot to explore and I enjoy making new memories.
